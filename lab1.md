## cd

![Image](Screenshot_4.png)
Initial working directory: ~/lecture1 
Working directory after: ~/ 
Running cd with no arguments resulted in the current working directory being switched to the root directory. This is not an error, as running cd without arguments is essentially equivalent to running cd ~, which switches to the root directory as expected.

Initial working directory: ~/ <br>
Working directory after: ~/lecture1/messages/ <br>
Running cd with a relative path to a directory as an argument resulted in the current working directory being switched to the requested path. This is expected behavior for cd; it didn't print any output and successfully switched the working directed to the requested path (relative to the current working directory). No errors present.
