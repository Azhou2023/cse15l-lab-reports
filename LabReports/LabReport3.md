# Lab Report 3

## Part 1 - Bugs

Bug in method `reversed()`: <br>

- ## Failure inducing input:

```
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{4, 3, 2, 1},
        ArrayExamples.reversed(input2));
}
```

- ## Input that does not induce failure:

```
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{},
        ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

- ## Symptom

  ![Image](../Screenshots/LabReport3/Screenshot_21.png)

- ## Bug <br>
  Original code:

```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

This code causes unexpected output because on line 4, we are assining values to the original array from the new array when it should be the other way around; for the reversal to work as expected, we need to assign values to the new array going backward from the input array, like so:

```
 static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

Simply switching `arr` and `newArray` in line 4 (and returning `newArray`) fixes the bug, as we have resolved the issue of values being assigned to the original array instead of the new one. With this change, values are now pulled from the original array (indexing backwards) and assigned to the new array. <br>

If we run the tests again, we'll see that the neither of inputs shown previously will no longer induce any errors: <br>

## Part 2 - Researching Commands: grep

- -c: count of times a pattern appears for every specified file

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -c -r "successful" | head -n 20
government/Media/Terrorist_Attack.txt:2
government/Media/Domestic_violence_aid.txt:0

government/Media/GreensburgDailyNews.txt:0
government/Media/AP_LawSchoolDebts.txt:0
```

The -c option displays each file and the number of times that the search parameter occurs within that file.
This particular command is showing the first 20 files, and we can see the files that contain the word and the number of times it appears in them. We can make this a bit more useful though:

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$  grep -c -r "successful" | sort -t ":" -k 2 -n | tail -n 10
government/Gen_Account_Office/Testimony_Jul17-2002_d02957t.txt:9
911report/chapter-3.txt:10
biomed/1471-2164-4-23.txt:13
government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt:13
government/Gen_Account_Office/ai00134.txt:13
government/About_LSC/State_Planning_Report.txt:20
government/Gen_Account_Office/gg96118.txt:20
government/Gen_Account_Office/d01376g.txt:25
government/Gen_Account_Office/Sept27-2002_d02966.txt:27
government/Gen_Account_Office/d02701.txt:30
```

By isolating and sorting the results, we get a list of the top 10 documents that match the specified query the most amount of times, as well as that specific count. This is super useful if we're looking for specific documents that may be more relevant to a phrase that we're looking for.

- -l: displays only filenames that contain the pattern

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -l -r "successful" | head -n 20
government/Media/Terrorist_Attack.txt
government/Media/Making_a_case.txt
government/Media/Barnes_new_job.txt
government/Media/Assuring_Underprivileged.txt
government/Media/Service_Agency.txt
government/Media/Nonprofit_Buys.txt
government/Media/BergenCountyRecord.txt
government/Media/Helping_Out.txt
government/Media/Poverty_Lawyers.txt
government/Media/Politician_Practices.txt
government/Media/Hard_to_Get.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctm4-10.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/final.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctf7-10.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/ro_clear_skies_book.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/nov1.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/bill.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/multi102902.txt
government/Env_Prot_Agen/jeffordslieberm.txt
government/About_LSC/State_Planning_Report.txt
```

The -l prints only the names of the files that contain instances of the requested query. This above command
shows 20 files that are guaranteed to contain at least 1 match to the requested word. Again though, we
can make this slightly more useful:

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -l -r "successful" | xargs grep -c "successful" | sort -t ":" -k 2 -n | head -n 10
911report/chapter-10.txt:1
911report/chapter-13.3.txt:1
911report/chapter-8.txt:1
biomed/1468-6708-3-4.txt:1
biomed/1471-2091-3-17.txt:1
biomed/1471-2105-2-8.txt:1
biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt:1
biomed/1471-2105-3-3.txt:1
biomed/1471-2105-3-38.txt:1
biomed/1471-2105-3-4.txt:1
```

By combining the -l option with the -c option, we guarantee that any input to -c contains at least 1
match. This way, we can sort and display the 10 files with the least reference that are NOT 0. In other words,
we find the files that do contain the match in some capacity, but mention it least frequently (which is useful
in some obscure scenario I'm sure!)

- -n: displays the line numbers of the matched lines

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -n -r "successful" | head -n 20
government/Media/Terrorist_Attack.txt:103:are to be successful.

```

This is a pretty straightforward option that displays the line number of the file that the requested
query appears in. This is very useful for obvious reasons; if someone wants to get to the specific part
of a document that the requested query appears in, this option is perfect. We can combine this with the
sorting from earlier for a useful result:

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -c -r "successful" | sort -t ":" -k 2 -n | tail -n 1 | cut -d ":" -f 1 | xargs grep -n "successful"

```

By using -n on the file that we know contains the most amount of mentions of the query,
we can get a comprehensive list of every time that query appears and the line that it appears at.
This is super helpful for finding out exactly where and why the document uses the requested phrase so often.

- -L: shows all files that do NOT match the pattern

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -r -L "the"
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$
```

With the empty result from running the above command, we can see that there isn't a single document in the
entire directory that does not contain the word "the" (which I guess is to be expected). This can also be used
in an interesting way, as a profanity filter of sorts:

```
andrewyz@DESKTOP-IH649LH:~/docsearch/technical$ grep -r -L "****" | head -n 20
government/Media/Terrorist_Attack.txt
government/Media/Domestic_violence_aid.txt
government/Media/fight_domestic_abuse.txt
government/Media/Entities_Merge.txt
government/Media/Free_legal_service.txt
government/Media/Philly_Lawyers.txt
government/Media/Making_a_case.txt
government/Media/Legal_system_fails_poor.txt
government/Media/Barnes_new_job.txt
government/Media/defend_yourself.txt
government/Media/Wingates_winds.txt
government/Media/City_Council_Budget.txt
government/Media/BusinessWire2.txt
government/Media/Legal_services_for_poor.txt
government/Media/Funds_Shortage.txt
government/Media/Butler_Co_attorneys.txt
government/Media/Ginny_Kilgore.txt
government/Media/Court_Keeps_Judge_From.txt
government/Media/GreensburgDailyNews.txt
government/Media/AP_LawSchoolDebts.txt
```

I've censored the above query for obvious reasons, but just take my word that it was a not very nice
word; this option allows us to find every file that does not contain that specific profanity. Chaining this with other options to eliminate allows us to create a pretty reliable profanity filter that does not show any documents
containing words we don't want to see. <br>
